# I built a React Blog from YouTube

This project was learned from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qZE0HUclfA&t=11s.

## Why was this worth my time?

I like this "teacher"'s style and I am trying to learn Javascript/React by doing hundreds of projects

### Struggles

I spent hours and hours debugging, and the end product is not perfect.

### Victories

I was able to add a teeny tiny custom bit in like 1 minute, so this is a humblebrag, thank you very much
